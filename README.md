# gRPC-based NFS Simulator

## Description
This repository hosts a Python project that simulates a basic Network File System (NFS) using the gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call) framework. The project aims to provide a platform for understanding remote procedure calls and network file sharing through a simplified NFS-like system.

## Features
- **gRPC Implementation:** Utilizes gRPC for efficient remote communication between the client and server.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Implements a client-server model allowing remote access to files stored on the server.
- **File Operations:** Supports fundamental file operations including read, write, create, delete, and list operations on files and directories.
- 
## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Core programming language for the project.
- **gRPC:** Framework for implementing remote procedure calls.
- **Protocol Buffers:** Used for defining the interface and data structures for communication between client and server.
